# parallel_computing_stereoscopic_depth_perception
Please read:
• There are four code files from our analysis which are as follows and we prefer if we run the code files in the following order:
o First implementation: basic_sequential.py
o Second implementation: Basic Parallel.py
o Third implementation: improved sequential.py
o Fourth implementation: Improved Parallel.py
• There are two image files in png format namely: left_bw.png, right_bw.png that needed to be in the same directory as the code files in order to run all the above models.
